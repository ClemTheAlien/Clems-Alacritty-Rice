# Clems Alacritty Rice

This is ClemTheAliens personal Alacritty config 

I also included a folder of my personal favorite themes from the https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes project.

## Copy Only My TOML file
```sh
wget -O /.config/alacritty/ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ClemTheAlien/Clems-Alacritty-Rice/clem.yml
```

NOTE: Make sure to change the path of the import line to whatever color scheme you want or just copy n' paste your own and remove the import line
