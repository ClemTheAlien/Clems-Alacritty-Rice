# Clems Alacritty Rice

This is ClemTheAliens personal Alacritty config 

I also included a folder of my personal favorite themes from the https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes project. When i do not use prebuilt color schemes I use pywal: https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal.

## Prerequisites
+ Install Git (obviously)
+ Make an Alacritty config file (go into .config and make a folder called 'alacritty' so you can copy the config there)
  + Make sure the directory is empyt as well
+ CHANGE OR REMOVE THE IMPORT PATH IN THE TOML FILE TO YOUR DESIRED COLOR SCHEME
+ INSTALL THE FIRA CODE FONT PACK 

## Git Clone
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ClemTheAlien/Clems-Alacritty-Rice .config/alacritty
```
