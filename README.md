# Clems Alacritty Rice

This is ClemTheAliens personal Alacritty config 

I also included a folder of my personal favorite themes from the https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes project.

## Prerequisites
+ Install Git (obviously)
+ Make an Alacritty config file (go into .config and make a folder called 'alacritty' so you can copy the config there)
+ CHANGE OR REMOVE THE IMPORT PATH IN THE TOML FILE TO YOUR DESIRED COLOR SCHEME

## Git Clone
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ClemTheAlien/Clems-Alacritty-Rice .config/alacritty
```
